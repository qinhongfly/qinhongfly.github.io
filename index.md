## Short Bio   
---   
Currently, I am leading a R&D team in DJI, to spearhead the design and development of the Next-Generation Flight System. We're seeking highly motivated, self-disciplined engineers with expertise in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decision-Making, and Planning to join our cutting-edge project.

Prior to this, I lead the End-to-End Autonomous Driving R&D team at SenseAuto, overseeing technical development across Perception, SLAM, Prediction, and Algorithm Engineering. Concurrently, I served as Technical Lead for mass production initiatives with automotive partners GAC and FAW, delivering production-ready solutions for commercial deployment.

My primary R&D interests are centered around computer vision and its applications in robotics, such as autonomous driving. My ultimate goal is to create AI-enhanced products that offer tangible benefits to people's daily lives. I am currently penning a Tech Column on [知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1776566920101675008), sharing my perspectives on autonomous driving and AI. Feel free to reach out for a discussion.
     
I got my M.S. degree in the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Guofeng Zhang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/gfzhang/). Before that, I received the B.S. degree of Digital Media Technology in Zhejiang University.
