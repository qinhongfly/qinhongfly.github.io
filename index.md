## Short Biography
---  
Currently I am a senior R&D Manager at SenseTime, leading the perception model&application team in intelligent driving group. Before that, I was also responsible for the prediction team.    

We are recruiting self-motivated researchers/developers.
If you are instrested in topics related to autonoumous driving, including perception, sensor fusion, trajectory prediction and software engineering, please send me your CV.   

Before I joined SenseTime in 2018, I got my M.S. degree in the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), supervised by [Prof. Guofeng Zhang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/gfzhang/). Before that, I received the B.S. degree of Digital Media Technology in Zhejiang University in 2015.
