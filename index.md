## Short Bio   
Currently I am a Director at SenseTime, engaged in R&D related to autonomous driving.   
I am the head of 4 R&D departments, including Perception R&D Center,  SLAM R&D Center, Mass Production System Develoment Department, and Mass Production Delivery Test Department.    
At the same time, I am also in charge of the development of our L2++ system SenseAuto Pilot, and the tech lead of the GAC Mass Production Project.    
Before that, I was also responsible for the Prediction Team.      
I got my M.S. degree in the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html) in 2018, supervised by [Prof. Guofeng Zhang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/gfzhang/). Before that, I received the B.S. degree of Digital Media Technology in Zhejiang University.

- Perception, especially vision-centric bev and mapless related   
- Doamin Adaption  
- Motion Prediction   
- MOT / Sensor Fusion  
- End2End AD
