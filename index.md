## Short Biography
---  
Currently I am a research manager at SenseTime, leading the Analysis and Prediction team in autonomous driving. Our goal is to restore the dynamic scene and analyze it to make the autonomous driving system more intelligent. 

<font color="#ff0f00">We are recruiting self-motivated researchers/developers. If you are instrested in perception (e.g, object detection, attribute analysis, state estimation and tracking, etc.), prediction(e.g, scene understanding, trajectory prediction, etc.) or automomous driving system engineering, please send me your CV. </font>  

Before I joined SenseTime in 2018, I got my M.S. degree in the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), supervised by [Prof. Guofeng Zhang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/gfzhang/). Before that, I received the B.S. degree of Digital Media Technology in Zhejiang University in 2015.
